# Travel App
### Objective:
The app will utilize three different free public APIs: Mapbox, DarkSky and Pixabay. This app is going to forecast the weather of the location that the users plans to travel to by having them type in the location and the date. The purpose of this app is to help user find the right temperature and preciprocity percentage of the location so that they will have a general idea of how the weather is going to be like and they know what to pack.

### What I Have Learn:
In this app, I learned how to use multiple APIs with each API being in one file, then I called the APIs and combine them all together using NodeJS and Express library to generate dynamic results. I also learned how to use fetch().then().then() in the front end to fetch the url that was created in the server side, convert the result to JSON and render it on the screen.

# How To Use The App?
